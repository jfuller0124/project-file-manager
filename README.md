# Project File Manager

This is a full-stack client portal app built with Next.js and Supabase. Users can upload files per project, preview them, and toggle a file lock to prevent deletion.

## Why I Built This
I built this project to solve issues I faced managing shared project files and preventing accidental overwrites.

## Features
- File upload & download via Supabase Storage
- Real-time project data via Supabase DB
- Lock/unlock file toggle with Supabase RLS
- Lightbox preview for images

## Technologies
- Next.js
- Supabase (Auth, Storage, PostgreSQL)
- TypeScript
- 
## What I Learned
- Designing secure backend workflows
- Implementing row-level security policies
- Building scalable, cloud-hosted systems
